# Programming Exercise

As part of our interviewing process, we are asking potential candidates to spend up to four hours on a programming exercise.  We understand that spending four hours developing a simple application may not give us a thorough understanding of your programming skills.  Even though this is small application, please treat it as if it were going to grow into a large system, maintained by a team of developers. We value correctness and robustness above everything else.

Complete as much of the application as you can and approach it as though you would any project you were starting out on.

## Hangman
Create a simple version of the game Hangman, where the computer chooses a word within a chosen theme and the user tries to guess it by suggesting letters.  Feel free to use any theme you want.  We're assuming you've played it, but if not, let us know and we can flush out the requirements a little more. We've included images that you can use so that you don't have to spend any time building them.

The following mockup is for illustration purposes only, please feel free to change it however you like.


## Requirements

1. Use any web framework you would like to build the app
2. The game must work in a modern browser like Chrome, Safari or Firefox
3. Users can start a new game or resume an unfinished game.
4. Commit to github frequently so we can see your progress over time

## Github

This project should have been provided to you via GitHub. Please commit to that project frequently.
